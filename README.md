# docker-fullcycle

This challenge is very exciting especially if you have never worked with the Go language!
You will have to publish an image to docker hub. When we run:

docker run <your-user>/codeeducation

We have to have the following result: Full Cycle Rocks!

If you notice, this image just prints the message as a final result, so it's worth checking out Go Lang's own website to learn how to make a "hello world".

Remembering that Go Lang has official images ready, it is worth checking the Docker Hub.

3) The image of our Go project needs to be less than 2MB =)

Tip: In the intro video about Docker when we talk about the layered file system, I present a "root" image, maybe it's a good one to use.

Have a good time
